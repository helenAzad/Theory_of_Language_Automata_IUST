# Theory of Language Automata (TLA) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains four primary projects related to the Theory of Language Automata (TLA):

1. **Accept-string-in-finiteAutomata**: A tool to check if a given string is accepted by a finite automaton.
2. **PDA-Calculator**: A calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using a Pushdown Automaton (PDA).
3. **String-Belong-to-grammar**: A tool to check if a given string can be generated by a specified grammar.
4. **Turing-Machine**: A simulation of a Turing Machine to process strings based on defined rules.

## Repository Structure

- **Accept-string-in-finiteAutomata**: Contains the code and resources for the finite automaton string acceptance checker.
- **PDA-Calculator**: Contains the code and resources for the PDA-based calculator.
- **String-Belong-to-grammar**: Contains the code and resources for the grammar-based string validator.
- **Turing-Machine**: Contains the code and resources for the Turing Machine simulator.
- **tests**: Includes unit tests for all projects to ensure correctness.
- **docs**: Holds documentation files, including detailed usage instructions and developer guides for all projects.

## Features

### Accept-string-in-finiteAutomata

- **Finite Automaton Definition**: Allows users to define states, transitions, and accepting states.
- **String Acceptance**: Checks if a given string is accepted by the defined finite automaton.
- **Output**: Prints `Accepted` if the string is valid according to the automaton, otherwise prints `Rejected`.

### PDA-Calculator

- **Operators**: Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` for exponentiation, and `sqrt` for square roots.
- **Functions**: Handles trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), `abs` for absolute value, and exponential functions (`exp`, `ln`).
- **Parentheses Handling**: Correctly processes nested and balanced parentheses.
- **Error Handling**: Detects invalid expressions, division by zero, and domain errors for functions.
- **Output**: Prints the result of the expression with two decimal places or `INVALID` if the input is not valid.

### String-Belong-to-grammar

- **Grammar Specification**: Accepts grammars with nullable transitions and multiple rules separated by `|`.
- **Validation**: Determines if a given string can be produced by the grammar.
- **Output**: Prints `Accepted` if the string is valid according to the grammar, otherwise prints `Rejected`.

### Turing-Machine

- **Turing Machine Definition**: Allows users to define states, tape alphabet, transitions, and accepting/rejecting states.
- **String Processing**: Simulates the Turing Machine to process and modify strings based on the defined rules.
- **Output**: Prints the final state of the tape and the Turing Machine status (Accepted/Rejected).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the `docs` folder. This includes user guides, developer notes, and examples for all projects.
